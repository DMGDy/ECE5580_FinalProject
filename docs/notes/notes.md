relevant information i need to know for the simulator

# Performance Factors


## Execution Time
(pg 290)
Affected by 
* Length of operand vectors
* structural hazards
* data dependencies

Initiation rate - rate vector unit consumes and produces new operands





## Lanes

# Pipeline Stages

## Fetch
Go into Instruction Queue (IQ)

## Decode and Rename
Decode then map physical registers to virtual Registers (RAT)
Reorder buffer is alson allocated

# Hazards

## Chaining

Chain from functional units to other functional units and to
store unit, but not load unit to functional units
